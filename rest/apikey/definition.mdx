An API key allows to make calls through the API. It is linked to an [organization](/rest/organization/definition).

Managing API Keys is an advanced feature that allows developers to orchestrate access to their API. This enable them to issue API Keys for their clients dynamically.

<Note>
API Keys can only access API Keys within the organization they belong to.
