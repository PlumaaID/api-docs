An organization is a group of [subjects](/rest/subject/definition) that share access to the same resources.

Subjects are granted membership to the organization by creating an [organization member](/rest/organizationmember/definition) entity.

An organization can create:

- [Signature Requests](/rest/signaturerequest/definition) to request digital signatures from subjects.
- [Signature Request Invites](/rest/signaturerequestinvite/definition) to invite subjects to sign requests.
- [Links](/rest/organizationlink/definition) with subjects to access their digital signature certificates
- [API Keys](/rest/apikey/definition) to access the API
- [Tokenized endorsables](/rest/endorsable/definition) to trace documents in the blockchain

<Note>
An Organization is limited in scope to the assets and resources it owns. It can't access resources from other organizations.
