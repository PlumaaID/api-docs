A certificate is a digitally signed statement from one entity ([the issuer](../issuer/definition)) that another entity ([the subject](../subject/definition)) has a given identity.

The certificate associates a public key with the identity of the subject. The certificate is signed by the issuer to prove the authenticity of the association.

The issuer is a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) certified by [Banxico](https://banxico.org.mx/), and the subject is typically a person or organization ("persona física o moral" in México).

<Note>
Certificates are only accessible to organizations authorized by the owner of the certificate. The subject owner must create an [organization link](../organizationlink/definition) to the organization that will access the certificate.
