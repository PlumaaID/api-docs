Easily leverage Plumaa ID as an infrastructure provider to enable capital market workflows secured by cryptographic digital signatures.

## Welcome, developers!

Thorugh an internal GraphQL architecture, our rest API is automatically generated along with our OpenAPI schema. This provides good flexibility to integrate with third party systems.

Although the basic use case is to send a [signature request](./signaturerequest/definition), [invites to sign](./signaturerequestinvite/definition) and query signature status, the API can be used to structure private debt transactions, tokenized assets, and more.

- Get started with our [quick start guide](./quickstart) to create a signature request, send invites, and get it signed.
- Understand the [key concepts](./concepts) of the API and how they relate to each other.
- Get an [overview of the API](./overview), its architecture, and how it's structured.
- Learn how to [authenticate](./authentication) yourself when calling the API.
