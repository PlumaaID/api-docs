Price oracle is a collection of endpoints that expose price feeds indexed by Plumaa ID and exposed through the API for popular asset pairs.

<Note>
Plumaa ID does not provide liquidity for any of these pairs. The prices are provided by third-party oracles.
</Note>

The time series are calculated by indexing Chainlink [Data Feeds](https://data.chain.link/feeds). When prices are not immediately available (e.g. MXN/USDC), then the price is calculated by crossing the prices of the two pairs (e.g. MXN/USD and USD/USDC).

The implementation of the price oracle is open-sourced in our protocol indexer
