An Organization Link is a relationship between an [organization](../organization/definition) and an [subject](../subject/definition). It is created with the user's authorization, so that their information remains on their control.

During the time the link exists, it's possible for the organization to access the subject information.

### How to establish an Organization Link?

Users can scan a QR code to establish the link. They will be prompted to accept it and can remove it at any time from their mobile app.

The QR can be generated by anyone using the API. Its format is standardized to:

```
https://api.plumaa.id/app/home/connect/<organization id>
```
