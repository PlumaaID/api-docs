title: Get  signed URL to upload a file
openapi: get /sign-file-url
---

This endpoint returns a signed URL that can be used to upload a file to the server.

The response will return a `filePath` that can be used to upload the file and a `key` that identifies the object in the Plumaa ID storage infrastructure.

Using the `key`, the client can [create a signature request](../signaturerequest/post-signature-request) by providing the `key` as the file argument (depending on the content type).

<Note>
The signed URL is valid for 15 minutes
