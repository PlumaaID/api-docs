A subject is a user of the platform. It is either person or a business ("persona f√≠sica o moral" in Spanish)
identified by a certificate. Given the platform can only be accessed with credentials issued from an [issuer](../issuer/definition), a subject is already identified.

The subjects are the main actors in the platform. They can join organizations as [members](../organizationmember/definition) to create [signature requests](../signaturerequest/definition), send [signature request invites](../signaturerequestinvite/definition), manage [links](../organizationlink/definition) with subjects, configure [API keys](../apikey/definition) and create [endorsables](../endorsable/definition).

Each user has a corresponding non-custodial [wallet](../wallet/definition) controlled by their digital signature. This way, the user can access digital assets and sign transactions securely.
